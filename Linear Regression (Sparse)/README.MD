The algorithm is developed as part of the FYP Project (FTEC4998 & FTEC4999)

The algorithm consist of two section, which are the initialization and solve. We also provided an ipython notebook in order to show how the algorithm works. 

The initialization part is derived from https://github.com/alisaab/l0bnb and the paper Sparse Regression at Scale: Branch-and-Bound rooted in First-Order Optimization
